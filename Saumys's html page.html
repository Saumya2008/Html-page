    <p>Personality is something that people tend to think a lot about.
        When we meet new people, whether through work, school, or social events,
        it is often their personality on which we immediately focus. Whether they are nice,
        helpful, <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/outgoing">outgoing</a>, or shy are just a
        few of the things that we assess as we <a

        the people around us.</p>
    <h2>
        What Is Personality Development?
    </h2>
    <p>
        It is our personality that makes us who we are, but how exactly do our personalities form?
        Personality development has been a major topic of interest for some of the most prominent
        thinkers in <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/psychology">psychology</a>. Since the
        <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/inception">inception</a> of psychology
        as a separate science,
        <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/researcher">researchers</a> have proposed a variety
        of ideas to explain how and why personality develops.
    </p>
    <p>
        Personality development refers to how the organized patterns of behavior that make up each
        person's unique personality <a
            href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/emerge?q=emerge">emerge</a> over time. Many
        factors go into <a
            href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/influence?q=influencing+">influencing</a>
        personality,
        including genetics, environment, parenting, and societal variables. Perhaps most importantly,
        it is the ongoing interaction of all of these influences that continue to shape personality
        over time.

    <h2>Key Theories</h2>
    <p>
        Our personalities make us unique, but how does personality develop? How exactly do we become
        who we are today? What factors play the most important role in the formation of personality?
        Can personality ever change?
    </p>
    <p>
        To answer this question, many prominent theorists developed theories to describe various
        steps and stages that occur on the road of personality development. The following theories
        focus on various aspects of personality development, including cognitive, social, and moral
        development.
    </p>
    <h2>Freud's Stages of Psychosexual Development</h2>
    <p>
        In addition to being one of the best-known thinkers in the area of personality development, Sigmund Freud
        remains one of the most controversial. In his well-known stage theory of psychosexual development, Freud
        suggested that personality develops in stages that are related to specific erogenous zones. Failure to complete
        these stages, he suggested, would lead to personality problems in adulthood.
    </p>
    <h2>Freud's Structural Model of Personality</h2>
    <p>Freud not only theorized about how personality developed over the course of childhood, but he also
        developed a framework for how overall personality is structured. According to Freud, the basic driving
        force of personality and behavior is known as the libido. This libidinal energy fuels the three components
        that make up personality: the id, the ego, and the superego.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The id is the aspect of personality present at birth. It is the most primal part of the <br>personality
            and drives people to fulfill their most basic needs and urges.
        </li>
        <p>
            <li>
                The ego is the aspect of personality charged with controlling the urges of the id and forcing <br> it to
                behave in realistic ways.
            </li>
        </p>
        <li>
            The superego is the final aspect of personality to develop and contains all of the ideals, morals,
            and values <br> imbued by our parents and culture. This part of personality attempts to make the ego behave
            according to these ideals. <br> The ego must then moderate between the primal needs of the id, the
            idealistic
            standards of the superego and reality.
