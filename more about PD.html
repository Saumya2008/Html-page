    <p>An individual's personality refers to his/her appearance, characteristics, attitude, mindset
        <br> and behavior with others.
    </p>
    <p><b>Let us go through the importance of personality development.</b></p>
    <p>
        <b>Personality development grooms an individual and helps him make a mark of his/her own.</b>
        <br>Individuals need to have a style of their own for others to follow them. Do not blindly copy others.
        <br>You need to set an example for people around. Personality development not only makes you look
        <br> good and presentable but also helps you face the world with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Personality development goes a long way in reducing stress and conflicts.</b> It encourages
        Individuals to look at the brighter sides of life.Face even the worst situations with a smile.
        Trust me, flashing your trillion dollar smile will not only melt half of your problems but also
        evaporate your stress and worries. There is no point cribbing over minor issues and problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Personality development helps you develop a positive attitude in life. An individual with a negative attitude
            finds a problem in every situation.</b> Rather than cribbing and criticizing people around, analyze the
        whole
        situation and try to find an appropriate solution for the same. Remember, if there is a problem, there has to be
        a solution as well. Never lose your cool. It would make the situation worse.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is essential for individuals to behave well with people around. Being polite with others will not only make
        you popular among other people but also earn you respect and pride. You can't demand respect by being rude with
        people around. Personality development plays an important role in developing not only your outer but also inner
        self. Human being is a social animal. One needs people around. An individual needs to have that magnetic power
        which attracts people towards him. You need to have that charisma of yours. Personality development helps you
        gain recognition and acceptance from the society as well as people around.
    </p>
    <p>
        Personality development plays an essential role not only in an individual's professional but also personal
        lives. It makes an individual disciplined, punctual and an asset for his/her organization. An in-disciplined
        individual finds it difficult to survive in the long run. Personality development teaches you to respect not
        only your Boss and fellow workers but also family members, friends, neighbours, relatives and so on. Never make
        fun of anyone at the workplace. Avoid criticizing and making fun of your fellow workers.
    </p>
    <p style="color: red">
        <u>One should never carry his/her attitude or personal grudges to work. Office is not a place where you can be
            rude
            to others just because you had a fight with your friend last night. Personality development sessions help
            you
            differentiate between your personal as well as professional life. It is really essential to keep a balance
            between both the lives to lead a peaceful and stress free life.</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Personality development helps an individual to inculcate positive qualities like punctuality, flexible
            attitude,
            willingness to learn, friendly nature, eagerness to help others and so on.</b> Never hesitate to share
        information
        with others. Always reach office on time. Some people have a tendency to work till late. Late sittings not only
        increase your stress levels but also spoil your personal life. Sitting till late at the office indicates that an
        individual is extremely poor in time management skills.

        <p>
            <b>Who do you think is a valuable employee</b>? An individual becomes a burden on his/her organization when
            he
            fails to
            perform additional tasks beyond his/her regular key responsibility areas. Multitalented employees definitely
            have an edge over those who restrict themselves only to a particular task and fail to contribute in other
            departments and areas. Organizations tend to retain those who show active interest in attending various
            training
            programs, seminars or relevant workshops in order to constantly upgrade their knowledge and acquire
            additional
            skills.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Gone are the days when employees could afford to just stick to what they have been doing for ages. <br>In
        today's
        scenario, individuals are expected to actively participate and contribute in other departments<br> as well and
        also
        overall productivity of the organization. A front office executive is no longer expected<br> to attend only
        phone
        calls throughout the day. He/she needs to constantly upgrade his/her skills and take<br> active interest in
        other
        related departments as well such as administration, logistics, office transportation<br> and so on. As a
        marketing
        employee if you call ten clients a day, brief them about your organization's<br> offerings and feel that your
        work
        is over, you are sadly mistaken. You need to find out and implement <br> innovative marketing strategies and
        techniques to not only sell your organization's products and services <br> but also attract potential clients.
        Retaining customers is also one of the most challenging aspects of marketing.<br> Trust me; you need to read a
        lot,
        and keep your eyes and ears open to reach to various unique marketing <br> solutions. Constant up gradation of
        knowledge is the need of the hour.

        <u><b>Personal development plays a crucial role in one's career growth. An individual who can contribute not
                only in
                his area of expertise but other domains as well are bound to get quick promotions and lucrative
                incentives and
                rewards. Trust me, personal development is imperative not only for career growth but also for mere
                survival in
                the organization. No organization would like to retain an individual who is resistant to changes and
                fails to
                perform in unpredictable and unforeseen situations.</b></u>

        <br>Personal development helps you set goals and expectations for yourself. Any individual without a vision in
        life
        not only fails to deliver but also gets easily lost in the crowd. It is important to set expectations for
        yourself. There is a scope of improvement always. Never ever feel that you are the best and you know everything.
        Believe me, that there are many things under the sky which we still do not know and need to find.
